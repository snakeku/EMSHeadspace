## Catalyst

#### What prompted me to start this project was a work-email from Public Service Division, Prime Minister’s Office asking, ‘What do you imagine the public officer of the future to be?’.

So I pondered about what the future meant to me, and looked at the local scene for inspiration. I saw how Singapore’s digital transformation helps create profound effect in their citizen’s life. And they did this because they want to see people’s life more empowered to live meaningful and fulfilled lives, enabled seamlessly by technology.

## My Interpretation of Future Public Officer

###### Rough sketch to the idea of a Future Public Officer
Inspired by Singapore's digital transformation, I decided to embark on my own digitalisation journey where I adopt a similar approach. I envisioned that SCDF officers are equipped with tools that can offer incredible functionality in their app, including displaying up-to-date content and data across both Apple & Android ecosystem and much more.

After submitting the idea, I thought why not make it a reality? If we can send a man to the moon, why cant we solve our domestic operational issues? So I decided to create a project centering around my organisation’s strategic asset – it’s people.

## [Challenges](#challenges) 
Following discussion with my colleagues, understanding their pain-points, I was trying to architect a system that not only solve operational problems, but to also effectively rethink processes and also at the same time be able to find it’s value in tomorrow's tech trends and remain viable for decades.

Some of the challenges involves:
1. ## Increasing Complexity in Frontline Operations.
- Increasing number of appliances, equipment, personnel or emergence of unexpected elements which results in increased complexity in frontline management.
2. ## Data Silos
- Variable or dated information found on different platform. Making finding for information complex and unnecessarily frustrating.
3. ## Resource efficiency
- Reliance on the traditional paper, pen and office supplies for processes.
4. ## Handling mindset shift
- Having to reshape and handle attitudes and behaviour when it comes to digitalisation.
